Playing around with Github for version control is a goal of mine. Every time I've got hard code with command line options, I go blank. HTML, CSS I can do. This stuff... eh.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
